## Attivio Search UI Front End

The Attivio Search UI is a web application written in JavaScript and based on the React project. It runs in the userâ€™s browser. This component consists of application-level code for searching the Attivio index, including the definitions of the pages in the application and the logic of how they're connected.

## Developer's Guide

See the [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/attivio/searchui/blob/master/DevelopersGuide.md) for instructions on setting up your development environment and building the Search UI application.

While developing your application, you'll want to see the effects of your changes immediately rather than relying on Maven builds producing artifacts that you can deploy. Fortunately, Node.js provides a convenient way to do this.

See the front end's [Developer's Guide](Developing.MD) for instructions.
