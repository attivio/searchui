# Developing with Search UI

This document describes some techniques you may find helpful while developing with the Search UI project.

## Development Environment

While you don’t need to have anything installed other than Maven when building the project, you will want to have Node and the Node Package Manager installed directly on your development machine to facilitate quick turnarounds while developing.

### Node and Yarn

You can obtain Node from the [project’s website](https://nodejs.org). The build tools for the front-end code require Node to run. The current version of Node, which is known to work, is 13.3.0 (newer versions should work as well, though they have not been tested).

You must also install Yarn. You can obtain it from [the Yarn project’s website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). Yarn is prefered to 
NPM as a tool for running the scripts used when building the Search UI project; it is also what is used to build the SUIT library itself. The current version of Yarn, which is known to work, is 1.21.1 (newer versions should work as well, though they have not been tested).

### IDE

You are free to use whatever IDE or code editor you enjoy working with. However, in developing the SUIT library and the Search UI project, we have been using Microsoft’s free Visual Studio Code. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://code.visualstudio.com). It’s very configurable and has a lot of plug-ins available. We, for example, have it configured to automatically run Flow and ESLint on the code as we type, which helps eliminate errors more efficiently.

## Running

Early in the development of the project we were using Webpack’s development server but once the project moved to live inside either the WAR file for app-server deployments or the ZIP file for Attivio-module deployments, the separate server was too dissimilar to the actual runtime environment for testing to be very useful. Here is what we do instead (we’ve also created scripts and bash aliases to automate some of these steps):

### Running with Tomcat

When running with Tomcat, we follow these steps for making changes and quickly seeing their effect in the UI.

First, run the normal Maven build (`mvn clean install` from the root directory of the searchui project, for example) to build the UI and the WAR file that wraps it. The WAR will be placed into the searchui/server/target directory. Copy the WAR file to Tomcat’s webapps directory, renaming it to match your basename (e.g., searchui.war). When Tomcat runs, it will automatically unpack the WAR into a directory (e.g., webapps/searchui).

The output of the Webpack build is in the directory WEB-INF/classes/static inside your webapp directory (e.g., $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/searchui/WEB-INF/classes/static). You can now use the command `yarn watch` from within the searchui/frontend directory, passing the path to this Webpack build output directory, to have Webpack watch the source tree for changes and continuously compile and update the expanded WAR:

`yarn watch $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/searchui/WEB-INF/classes/static`

Doing this, changes are visible in your browser after refreshing in a second or two after you’ve saved them in the editor.

You also get the advantages of running the application within the servlet, such as access to SAML-based single sign on, and the REST API proxying.

### Running as a Module

When running as an Attivio module, we follow these steps for making changes and quickly seeing their effect in the UI.

First, run the normal Maven build (`mvn clean install` from the root directory of the searchui project, for example) to build the UI and the module ZIP file that wraps it. The ZIP will be placed into the searchui/module/target directory. Run the command `aie-exec modulemanager -i` followed by the path to the ZIP file to install the module into the local copy of Attivio on your machine.

This will, among other things, add a directory to your Attivio installation under the `webapps/searchui/dist` directory. You can now use the command `yarn watch` from within the searchui/frontend directory, passing the path to this `webapps/searchui/dist` directory, to have Webpack watch the source tree for changes and continuously compile and update the expanded WAR.

Doing this, changes are visible in your browser after refreshing in a second or two after you’ve saved them in the editor.

You also get the advantages of running the application within the context of the node, such as access to Attivio’s web application security.

#### Running in Attivio 5.5.0

If you are running Search UI as a module inside an Attivio 5.5.0 installation, you will need to manually copy the file `configuration.properties.js` into the `resources/searchui` directory in your project’s configuration. You can then edit this file to configure your Search UI installation. This step is optional when installing into later versions of Attivio (5.5.1+), as the `configuration.properties.js` file in the installation will be used as a default if none exists in the project.

## Developing the SUIT Library Itself

If you need to make changes to the SUIT library itself, you can speed up your work by following the steps here in addition to those described in the SUIT project’s Developing.MD file.
